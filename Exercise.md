# Exercise on taxa abundance data retrieval and analysis

The study on the EBI Metagenomics Portal with project ID `SRP108566` has four samples (but many runs per sample). The data arises from metagenomic sequencing of human microbiome samples. Your task is to investigate biodiversity in the four samples, following the guidelines below. *Do not use a web browser!* Leave your web browser displaying only these instructions and see if you can accomplish this task completely using only R.

1. Download (and merge) the OTU data for the four samples (separately)
2. Produce plots of the species abundance patterns in each sample
3. How many species were observed in the samples?
4. How many individuals were observed in the samples?
5. Find estimates for the total number of species in the communities corresponding to the four samples.
6. Fit a selection of SAD models to the two samples. Which distribution fits best? `lnorm`? `poilog`? Something else? Is the same distribution best for all four samples?
7. Is it plausible that the samples are independent samples from the same meta-community?
