# Metagenomics data in R

Materials for taxa abundance/metagenomics hands-on training session

### Part 1
* [Working with taxa abundance data in R](TaxaAbundance.md)
* [Working with the MGnify portal from R](EBIMetagenomics.md)

### Part 2
* [**Exercises** on taxa abundance data retrieval and analysis](Exercise.md)

These materials are intended for a 2 hour hands-on training session at a [metagenomics workshop](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/events/2019/metagenomics-bioinformatics-2019), but should be suitable for self-study. You should probably allow 3 hours for self-study.
