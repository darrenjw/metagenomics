# Metagenomics data in R

Materials for taxa abundance/metagenomics hands-on training session

3 parts: roughly 20 minutes each

* [Working with taxa abundance data in R](TaxaAbundance.md)
* [Working with the EBI Metagenomics portal from R](EBIMetagenomics.md)
* [**Exercise** on taxa abundance data retrieval and analysis](Exercise.md)

These materials are intended for a 60 minutes hands-on training session at a [metagenomics workshop](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/events/2018/metagenomics-bioinformatics-3), but should be suitable for self-study. You should probably allow 2 hours for self-study.
